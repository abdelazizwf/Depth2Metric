# Depth2Metric

Intelligent depth-based measurements from simple images.

## Description

Estimate depth values from RBG images using [MiDaS](https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/) and turn them into point cloud using [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org/) for depth visualization.
The goal is to use the depth values with a camera model to measure distances within the image in real units.
